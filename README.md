# FENLACE

The name is short for FEniCS based NLACE. FEniCS is a collection of free software with an extensive list of features for automated and efficient solution of differential equations (https://fenicsproject.org). NLACE is short for NonLinear Adjoint based Coefficients Estimator. It is developed by Assad A. Oberai and his students. More details about NLACE can be found by examing Prof. Oberai's publication list (http://homepages.rpi.edu/~oberaa). NLACE solves practical inverse problems / PDE-constrained optimization problems mainly in the biology-related fields, such as tissue BioMechanical Imaging and cell Traction Force Microscopy, where the former one inverts for tissue properties and the latter inverts for cell surface traction.

NLACE is written in FORTRAN and parallelized in opemMP. In order to make use of the parallelism of MPI in FEniCS, we are trying to "re-write" NLACE in FEniCS with Python. The dolfin-adjoint package (http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/) in FEniCS could further simplify our implementation and speed up running time.
